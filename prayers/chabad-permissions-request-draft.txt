Subject: Permission Request — Audio Prayer Recordings for BeitOhr.ai Educational Project

Dear Chabad.org Permissions Team,

I am developing BeitOhr.ai, an educational technology project designed to help Jews learn and follow along with daily prayers and Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) using an interactive 3D character guide.

The application provides a sing-along experience where users can follow the text of prayers at their own pace, with audio guidance to help them learn proper pronunciation and nusach (liturgical melody).

I am writing to request permission to use audio recordings from your Tefillah Audio collection for this educational purpose. Specifically, I am interested in:

DAVENING (Prayer Services):
- Shema Yisrael and its blessings
- Amidah / Shemoneh Esrei (weekday and Shabbat)
- Kaddish (Nusach Ari / Chabad version)
- Barchu
- Aleinu
- Ashrei

BIRKAT HAMAZON (Grace After Meals):
- Full Birkat Hamazon recording
- Individual brachot if available (Hazan, Boneh Yerushalayim, HaTov v'HaMeitiv)
- Shir HaMaalot (Psalm 126)
- Zimun

Nusach Ari (Chabad) recordings are strongly preferred, as this is the tradition we aim to teach.

The audio would be used within the application to guide users through the prayer text, with user-controlled playback speed to accommodate different levels of familiarity. The recordings would be attributed to Chabad.org and the original performers.

I would be happy to discuss licensing terms, attribution requirements, or any other conditions you may have.

Thank you for your time and for the incredible work Chabad.org does making Jewish resources accessible worldwide.

B'vracha,
[Gabriel Greenstein]
